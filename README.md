## Install

Download {script_name}.cs under `scripts/` as needed, and move it to the `game_root_directory/scripts/`.
Some scripts need additional steps according to the `Note` section.

### change_tex_fix

Some mod textures do not follow the naming rules, such as `test_hair.tex`, this script is designed to load these textures and handle infinity colors normally, and it is recommended to install COM3D2.ExtendedErrorHandling.

Previously, these textures could only be loaded through `COM3D2.StopQuitting.Plugin`(without `COM3D2.ExtendedErrorHandling`), which interrupted the entire loading process by raising an exception, and the infinity color was not handled.

### dcm_sync_anm

When clicking the play button of `COM3D2.DanceCameraMotion.Plugin`, the item anm will be synchronized when DCM Play/Pause/Seek. If `COM3D2.MovieTexture.Plugin` is installed, the texture will also be synchronized.
Also added the DCM play shortcut key "`".

### extract_ks_scripts

Extract *.ks scripts for other purposes.
Press the E key on the main interface to start extracting.

### infinity_color_fix

* Note: Download `resources/InfinityColor_Fix` folder and move to `game_root_directory/BepinEx/config/`

Allow infinity colors to handle transparent channels.

Add Mask texture for infinity color.
Only need to create {name}.infinity_mask.tex for the texture {name}.tex that needs mask.
The grayscale [0-1] in the Mask texture determines whether the infinity color is displayed, 0 means that the original texture is not affected by the infinity color, and 1 means that the infinity color texture is displayed. The grayscale is allowed to be an intermediate value for mixing.

If `COM3D2.MaidLoader` is installed, the infinity color Mask texture will also be refreshed when the Mod Refresh button is clicked.

### partsedit_add_bone

Make Mune and Hip Bone Moveable and Scaleable for `COM3D2.PartsEdit.Plugin`.

### vym_syasei_sync_with_inoutanim

Allow Vym Syasei to sync With Inoutanim.

### wrap_mode_extend_sc

Make textures repeated for SceneCapture.
Copy from `wrap_mode_extend` (by ghorsington).

### model_extend

* Note: If slot_change has been installed before, you need to delete `slot_change.cs` in `game_root_directory/scripts/`.

Load the extended configs (basebone/shadow).
Automatically set BaseBoneName to `_ROOT_` when loading `*.bodybone.model` [legacy feature]

Example Config (create `{name}.exmodel.xml` for `{name}.model` in the same path):

```xml
<plugins>
    <plugin name="ModelExtend">
        <BaseBoneName>_ROOT_</BaseBoneName>
        <ReceiveShadows>True</ReceiveShadows>
        <ShadowCastingMode>On</ShadowCastingMode>
    </plugin>
</plugins>
```

Description:

1. BaseBoneName: Game loads models with different bone structures according to BaseBoneName. If you need to load a full-body model on some slots (like headset), set it to `_ROOT_`. For more information, please refer to the table below.
2. ReceiveShadows: [True|False] Whether to accept shadows
3. ShadowCastingMode: [Off|On|TwoSided|ShadowsOnly]
   * Off: cast no shadow
   * On: Cast shadow
   * TwoSided: Cast two-sided shadow
   * ShadowsOnly: Cast shadow only. The mesh itself will be hidden.

</details>

### npr_addition

* Note: Download `resources/NPRShader` folder and move to `game_root_directory/Sybaris/UnityInjector/Config`

Add Shader to `COM3D2.NPRShader.Plugin`.
[Shader Description](./resources/NPRShader/ShaderList.md)

### vym_enhance

`COM3D2.VibeYourMaid.Plugin` function enhance & potential error fix.

### mipmap_extend

All texture with `mipmap` in the name will enable Mipmap.

### mate_tex_cache

Cache textures and materials for COM3D2 and NPRShader.

Configuration `BepinEx/config/MateTexCache.cfg`:

1. GolbalEnable: Global Switch
2. IgnoreSkin: Not cache Materials and Textures on body/head
3. TempCacheCapacity: The size of the resource cache pool to be destroyed
4. MateCacheType:
    * All: Cache all `*.mate`
    * NPR_Only: Only cache `*NPR*.mate`
    * None: No cache
5. TexCacheType:
    * All: Cache all `*.tex`
    * ByMate: cache based on MateCacheType and material

For Mate:

* You can optionally add Float Value `_Cache=0` or `_Cache=1` in Mate to mark whether the material needs to be cached.

Priority (from high to low):

 1. Global Switch
 2. _Cache value in Mate
 3. IgnoreSkin
 4. MateCacheType & TexCacheType

If `COM3D2.MaidLoader` is installed, the refresh function of MaidLoader will mark all caches as expired. When loading expired caches, it will be decided whether to reload based on the file hash.

### ~~npr_930_dpi_fix~~

**Deprecated**
DPI Fix on 2K for NPRShader v930.
